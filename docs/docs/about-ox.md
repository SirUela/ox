Ox is a CLI for the Buffalo framework which is focused on making it easy to build and maintain Go applications with a set of  tools that may differ from the official Buffalo CLI. It's based on the [Buffalo](github.com/gobuffalo/buffalo) framework, and the [Go](https://golang.org/) programming language. 

One of the big differences between Ox and the official Buffalo CLI is the [plugin System](/docs/plugins), which allows you to add your own commands and Plugins to the Ox CLI.
