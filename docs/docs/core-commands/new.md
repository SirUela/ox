The `new` command generates a new Ox application with the ox [folder structure](/docs/fundamentals/folders). To create the app you can run the following command:

```sh
ox new <app-name>
```

The new command allows to override an existing folder with the -f flag, to use it you can run:

```sh
ox new <app-name> -f
```

In that case Ox will not ask for confirmation before overwriting the existing folder.
