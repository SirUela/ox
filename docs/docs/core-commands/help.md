The help command provides valuable information for each of the commands in the CLI. The help command shows the information it has about a command or subcommand. You can see the top level help by running:

```

Also, you can get specific help for a particular command by running `ox help [command]`. For example:

```
ox help new
ox help database create # shoes the information for the `create` subcommand .
```
