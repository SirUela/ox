In order to get started with the Ox CLI you should install. You can grab the binary from the github repository or you can install from source, which is the recommended way. To install from source you should run:

```sh
go install github.com/wawandco/ox/cmd/ox@latest
```

Once this completes you should have the Ox binary in your terminal. You can test it and see if it works by running:

```sh
ox help
```

You should see something like:

```sh
[info] Using wawandco/ox/cmd/ox
