Ox would not be possible without the continuous feedback from the engineering team at [Wawandco](https://wawand.co), the continuous conversations we have inside the company allow us to be always looking for better ways to do things on the CLI.

Also and not less important, this CLI would not be possible without the design that [@markbates](https://github.com/markbates) did on the `buffalo-cli`, thanks Mark for Buffalo and the Buffalo-cli plugin system.
